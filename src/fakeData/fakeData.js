            'When it comes to dental treatments, it might sometimes sound like your dental benefit plan is speaking a different language. If your dentist mentions these terms, you can ask questions, but your dental plan documents may not give you the answers you need immediately.

        fullDescription: `Many people who have migraines find that over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol, aspirin and ibuprofen, can help to reduce their symptoms. They tend to be most effective if taken at the first signs of a migraine attack, as this gives them time to absorb into your bloodstream and ease your symptoms.

        It's not advisable to wait until the headache worsens before taking painkillers, as it's often too late for the medicine to work.
        
        Tablets you dissolve in a glass of water (soluble painkillers) are a good alternative because they're absorbed quickly by your body.`,
